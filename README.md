# RecBole-FairRec

![logo](asset/logo.png)

**RecBole-FairRec** is a library toolkit built upon [RecBole](https://recbole.io) for reproducing and developing fairness-aware recommendation.

## Highlights

- **Easy-to-use**: Our library shares unified API and input(atomic files) as RecBole.
- **Conveniently learn and compare**: Our library provides several fairess-metrics and frameworks for learning and comparing.
- **Extensive FairRec library**: Recently proposed fairness-aware algorithms can be easily equipped in our library.

## Requirements

```
python>=3.7.0
recbole>=1.0.1
numpy>=1.20.3
torch>=1.11.0
tqdm>=4.62.3
```

## Quick-Start

With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```
python run_recbole.py
```
If you want to change the models or datasets, just run the script by setting additional command parameters:
```
python run_recbole.py -m [model] -d [dataset] -c [config_files]
```

## Implement Models

We list the models that we have implemented up to now:

- [FOCF](recbole/model/fair_recommender/focf.py) from Sirui Yao et al:[Beyond Parityï¼šFairness Objectives for Collaborative Filtering](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/e6384711491713d29bc63fc5eeb5ba4f-Abstract.html)(NIPS 2017). Note: We implement this model with ranking-based metrics, e.g. NDCG@K.
- PFCN from Yunqi Li et al:[Towards Personalized Fairness based on Causal Notion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3404835.3462966?casa_token=zzHePKuKP6AAAAAA:YzZp_qUbzsgd3TXWCAGSRAfEHO2oM0_BuWZ5uZlfj_rudqKGYq8douOaZ0GoizxP54jtz3JDFw725xo)(SIGIR 2021)

## Datasets

 The datasets used can be downloaded from [Datasets Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W6fvJN9ZjuyeqsIuUeodDJk_ajajHkoG).

# Hyper-parameters
We train the models with the default parameter settings, suggested in their original paper.[[link]](results/ml-1m.md)

## The Team
RecBole-FairRec is developed and maintained by members from [RUCAIBox](http://aibox.ruc.edu.cn/), the main developers is Jiakai Tang ([@Tangjiakai](https://github.com/TangJiakai)).
